  <h1 id="intro" > Becoming a Licensed Skydiver</h1>
    <p id="intro p"> The time I spent working toward my A-license for skydiving was the scariest, most frustrating, and some of the best of my life. The process may <br> seem intimidating, but anyone with the desire to jump out of a plane can do it and the skydiving community is extremely welcoming.<br> The process is flexible and can take as short as a week, or as long as several years, depending on individual goals and accessibility. </p>
</div>
  <h2> <strong> There are three main things to accomplish when working toward an A license.</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li> <strong> First Jump Course (FJC):</strong> Think of the FJC as a kind of Driver's Ed, except with more free-fall time. You'll spend 4-5 hours learning the basics, going over equipment, and solidifying your first dive-flow. After your class (weather permitting) you will take your first jump, which leads into-</li><br>
      <li> <strong>Accelerated Free Fall (AFF):</strong> The goal of Aff is to get you stable in the air, comfortable with exits, competent with equipment, and landing without too much drama. The AFF course consists of 7-14 jumps, depending on the jumpers ability to complete all requirements, which include things like recovering stability after a barrel roll, and pulling your own parachute at 6,000ft. One or two instructors will accompany you on the freefall portion of your jumps, depending on    stability. The goal is competence and comfortability with a focus on safety above all else, so you will be ready for- </li><br>
      <li><strong> Solo Jumps: </strong>  After finishing all requirements during AFF jumps, you will be cleared for solo status! The required number of jumps to apply for an A-license is 25, so during this time you will simply be running (or jumping) toward that finish line. Jumps between AFF and licensing can be completely solo, or you can pay a little extra for a coach, who will work with you on refining skills. The last requirement before applying for that A is a packing class, which is usually done during a students solo status time, as too not bog them down with too much information during AFF. </li>
    </ol><br>
        </br>
      Once these requirements are met, congratulations! You are a licensed skydiver!<br>
      Don't be afraid when your friends put a stamp on your forehead, throw a pie in your face,<br>
      and demand you buy beer for the dropzone, it's all a part of the process.<br>


<h3 id="SIM" class= "flex-container"> Your best friend through all of this will be the <a href="https://uspa.org/SIM">Skydiver's Information Manual</a>, or SIM. <br>You will find yourself and everyone around you refering to it constanly, it is the Sky Bible. </h3>

  <p> <strong> The dropzone I learned at is called <a href="https://www.outoftheblueskydiving.com/">Out of the Blue</a>.<br>
  It's located in Limon, Colorado and I highly recommend it, it's a great dropezone with even better people. </strong> </p>
